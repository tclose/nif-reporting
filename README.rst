A set of tools to assist generating data for NIF reporting

Detecting publications of users 
-------------------------------

There is a table of key users (i.e. CIs) in the ``databases/app.db`` database,
which are used to search Scopus for any publications in the current reporting
period.

New authors can be added using the ``scripts/add_authors.py`` script.
